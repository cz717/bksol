(** * Applying Theorems to Arguments *)

(** One feature of Coq that distinguishes it from many other proof
    assistants is that it treats _proofs_ as first-class objects.

    There is a great deal to be said about this, but it is not
    necessary to understand it in detail in order to use Coq.  This
    section gives just a taste, while a deeper exploration can be
    found in the optional chapters [ProofObjects] and
    [IndPrinciples]. *)

(** We have seen that we can use the [Check] command to ask Coq to
    print the type of an expression.  We can also use [Check] to ask
    what theorem a particular identifier refers to. *)

Check plus_comm.
(* ===> forall n m : nat, n + m = m + n *)

(** Coq prints the _statement_ of the [plus_comm] theorem in the same
    way that it prints the _type_ of any term that we ask it to
    [Check].  Why?

    The reason is that the identifier [plus_comm] actually refers to a
    _proof object_ -- a data structure that represents a logical
    derivation establishing of the truth of the statement [forall n m
    : nat, n + m = m + n].  The type of this object _is_ the statement
    of the theorem that it is a proof of.

    Intuitively, this makes sense because the statement of a theorem
    tells us what we can use that theorem for, just as the type of a
    computational object tells us what we can do with that object --
    e.g., if we have a term of type [nat -> nat -> nat], we can give
    it two [nat]s as arguments and get a [nat] back.  Similarly, if we
    have an object of type [n = m -> n + n = m + m] and we provide it
    an "argument" of type [n = m], we can derive [n + n = m + m].

    Operationally, this analogy goes even further: by applying a
    theorem, as if it were a function, to hypotheses with matching
    types, we can specialize its result without having to resort to
    intermediate assertions.  For example, suppose we wanted to prove
    the following result: *)

Lemma plus_comm3 :
  forall n m p, n + (m + p) = (p + m) + n.

(** It appears at first sight that we ought to be able to prove this
    by rewriting with [plus_comm] twice to make the two sides match.
    The problem, however, is that the second [rewrite] will undo the
    effect of the first. *)

Proof.
  intros n m p.
  rewrite plus_comm.
  rewrite plus_comm.
  (* We are back where we started... *)

(** One simple way of fixing this problem, using only tools that we
    already know, is to use [assert] to derive a specialized version
    of [plus_comm] that can be used to rewrite exactly where we
    want. *)

  rewrite plus_comm.
  assert (H : m + p = p + m).
  { rewrite plus_comm. reflexivity. }
  rewrite H.
  reflexivity.
Qed.

(** A more elegant alternative is to apply [plus_comm] directly to the
    arguments we want to instantiate it with, in much the same way as
    we apply a polymorphic function to a type argument. *)

Lemma plus_comm3_take2 :
  forall n m p, n + (m + p) = (p + m) + n.
Proof.
  intros n m p.
  rewrite plus_comm.
  rewrite (plus_comm m).
  reflexivity.
Qed.

(** You can "use theorems as functions" in this way with almost all
    tactics that take a theorem name as an argument.  Note also that
    theorem application uses the same inference mechanisms as function
    application; thus, it is possible, for example, to supply
    wildcards as arguments to be inferred, or to declare some
    hypotheses to a theorem as implicit by default.  These features
    are illustrated in the proof below. *)

Example lemma_application_ex :
  forall {n : nat} {ns : list nat},
    In n (map (fun m => m * 0) ns) ->
    n = 0.
Proof.
  intros n ns H.
  destruct (proj1 _ _ (In_map_iff _ _ _ _ _) H)
           as [m [Hm _]].
  rewrite mult_0_r in Hm. rewrite <- Hm. reflexivity.

(** * Coq vs. Set Theory *)

(** Coq's logical core, the _Calculus of Inductive Constructions_,
    differs in some important ways from other formal systems that are
    used by mathematicians for writing down precise and rigorous
    proofs.  For example, in the most popular foundation for
    mainstream paper-and-pencil mathematics, Zermelo-Fraenkel Set
    Theory (ZFC), a mathematical object can potentially be a member of
    many different sets; a term in Coq's logic, on the other hand, is
    a member of at most one type.  This difference often leads to
    slightly different ways of capturing informal mathematical
    concepts, though these are by and large quite natural and easy to
    work with.  For example, instead of saying that a natural number
    [n] belongs to the set of even numbers, we would say in Coq that
    [ev n] holds, where [ev : nat -> Prop] is a property describing
    even numbers.

    However, there are some cases where translating standard
    mathematical reasoning into Coq can be either cumbersome or
    sometimes even impossible, unless we enrich the core logic with
    additional axioms.  We conclude this chapter with a brief
    discussion of some of the most significant differences between the
    two worlds. *)

(** ** Functional Extensionality

    The equality assertions that we have seen so far mostly have
    concerned elements of inductive types ([nat], [bool], etc.).  But
    since Coq's equality operator is polymorphic, these are not the
    only possibilities -- in particular, we can write propositions
    claiming that two _functions_ are equal to each other: *)

Example function_equality_ex : plus 3 = plus (pred 4).
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(** In common mathematical practice, two functions [f] and [g] are
    considered equal if they produce the same outputs:
    (forall x, f x = g x) -> f = g
    This is known as the principle of _functional extensionality_.

    Informally speaking, an "extensional property" is one that
    pertains to an object's observable behavior.  Thus, functional
    extensionality simply means that a function's identity is
    completely determined by what we can observe from it -- i.e., in
    Coq terms, the results we obtain after applying it.

    Functional extensionality is not part of Coq's basic axioms: the
    only way to show that two functions are equal is by
    simplification (as we did in the proof of [function_equality_ex]).
    But we can add it to Coq's core logic using the [Axiom]
    command. *)

Axiom functional_extensionality : forall {X Y: Type}
                                    {f g : X -> Y},
  (forall (x:X), f x = g x) -> f = g.

(** Using [Axiom] has the same effect as stating a theorem and
    skipping its proof using [Admitted], but it alerts the reader that
    this isn't just something we're going to come back and fill in
    later!

    We can now invoke functional extensionality in proofs: *)

Lemma plus_comm_ext : plus = fun n m => m + n.
Proof.
  apply functional_extensionality. intros n.
  apply functional_extensionality. intros m.
  apply plus_comm.
Qed.

(** Naturally, we must be careful when adding new axioms into Coq's
    logic, as they may render it inconsistent -- that is, it may
    become possible to prove every proposition, including [False]!
    Unfortunately, there is no simple way of telling whether an axiom
    is safe: hard work is generally required to establish the
    consistency of any particular combination of axioms.  Fortunately,
    it is known that adding functional extensionality, in particular,
    _is_ consistent.

    Note that it is possible to check whether a particular proof
    relies on any additional axioms, using the [Print Assumptions]
    command. For instance, if we run it on [plus_comm_ext], we see
    that it uses [functional_extensionality]: *)

(** **** Exercise: 5 stars (tr_rev)  *)
(** One problem with the definition of the list-reversing function
    [rev] that we have is that it performs a call to [app] on each
    step; running [app] takes time asymptotically linear in the size
    of the list, which means that [rev] has quadratic running time.
    We can improve this with the following definition: *)

Fixpoint rev_append {X} (l1 l2 : list X) : list X :=

  | [] => l2
  | x :: l1' => rev_append l1' (x :: l2)

(** This version is said to be _tail-recursive_, because the recursive
    call to the function is the last operation that needs to be
    performed (i.e., we don't have to execute [++] after the recursive
    call); a decent compiler will generate very efficient code in this
    case.  Prove that both definitions are indeed equivalent. *)

(** ** Propositions and Booleans *)

(** We've seen that Coq has two different ways of encoding logical
    facts: with _booleans_ (of type [bool]), and with
    _propositions_ (of type [Prop]). For instance, to claim that a
    number [n] is even, we can say either (1) that [evenb n] returns
    [true] or (2) that there exists some [k] such that [n = double k].
    Indeed, these two notions of evenness are equivalent, as can
    easily be shown with a couple of auxiliary lemmas (one of which is
    left as an exercise).

    We often say that the boolean [evenb n] _reflects_ the proposition
    [exists k, n = double k].  *)

Theorem evenb_double : forall k, evenb (double k) = true.
Proof.
  intros k. induction k as [|k' IHk'].
  - reflexivity.
  - simpl. apply IHk'.
Qed.

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars (evenb_double_conv)  *)
Theorem evenb_double_conv : forall n,
  exists k, n = if evenb n then double k
                else S (double k).
Proof.

  - intros H. destruct (evenb_double_conv n) as [k Hk].
    rewrite Hk. rewrite H. exists k. reflexivity.
  - intros [k Hk]. rewrite Hk. apply evenb_double.
Qed.

(** Similarly, to state that two numbers [n] and [m] are equal, we can
    say either (1) that [beq_nat n m] returns [true] or (2) that [n =
    m].  These two notions are equivalent. *)

Theorem beq_nat_true_iff : forall n1 n2 : nat,
  beq_nat n1 n2 = true <-> n1 = n2.
Proof.
  intros n1 n2. split.
  - apply beq_nat_true.
  - intros H. rewrite H. rewrite <- beq_nat_refl. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** However, while the boolean and propositional formulations of a
    claim are equivalent from a purely logical perspective, we have
    also seen that they need not be equivalent _operationally_.
    Equality provides an extreme example: knowing that [beq_nat n m =
    true] is generally of little help in the middle of a proof
    involving [n] and [m]; however, if we convert the statement to the
    equivalent form [n = m], we can rewrite with it.

    The case of even numbers is also interesting.  Recall that, when
    proving the backwards direction of
    [even_bool_prop] ([evenb_double], going from the propositional to
    the boolean claim), we used a simple induction on [k]).  On the
    other hand, the converse (the [evenb_double_conv] exercise)
    required a clever generalization, since we can't directly prove
    [(exists k, n = double k) -> evenb n = true].

    For these examples, the propositional claims were more useful than
    their boolean counterparts, but this is not always the case.  For
    instance, we cannot test whether a general proposition is true or
    not in a function definition; as a consequence, the following code
    fragment is rejected: *)

Fail Definition is_even_prime n :=
  if n = 2 then true
  else false.

(** Coq complains that [n = 2] has type [Prop], while it expects an
    elements of [bool] (or some other inductive type with two
    elements).  The reason for this error message has to do with the
    _computational_ nature of Coq's core language, which is designed
    so that every function that it can express is computable and
    total.  One reason for this is to allow the extraction of
    executable programs from Coq developments.  As a consequence,
    [Prop] in Coq does _not_ have a universal case analysis operation
    telling whether any given proposition is true or false, since such
    an operation would allow us to write non-computable functions.

    Although general non-computable properties cannot be phrased as
    boolean computations, it is worth noting that even many
    _computable_ properties are easier to express using [Prop] than
    [bool], since recursive function definitions are subject to
    significant restrictions in Coq.  For instance, the next chapter
    shows how to define the property that a regular expression matches
    a given string using [Prop].  Doing the same with [bool] would
    amount to writing a regular expression matcher, which would be
    more complicated, harder to understand, and harder to reason
    about.

    Conversely, an important side benefit of stating facts using
    booleans is enabling some proof automation through computation
    with Coq terms, a technique known as _proof by
    reflection_. Consider the following statement: *)

Example even_1000 : exists k, 1000 = double k.

(** The most direct proof of this fact is to give the value of [k]
    explicitly. *)

 Proof. exists 500. reflexivity. Qed.

(** On the other hand, the proof of the corresponding boolean
    statement is even simpler: *)

Example even_1000' : evenb 1000 = true.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(** What is interesting is that, since the two notions are equivalent,
    we can use the boolean formulation to prove the other one without
    mentioning 500 explicitly: *)

Example even_1000'' : exists k, 1000 = double k.
Proof. apply even_bool_prop. reflexivity. Qed.

(** Although we haven't gained much in terms of proof size in this
    case, larger proofs can often be made considerably simpler by the
    use of reflection.  As an extreme example, the Coq proof of the
    famous _4-color theorem_ uses reflection to reduce the analysis of
    hundreds of different cases to a boolean computation.  We won't
    cover reflection in great detail, but it serves as a good example
    showing the complementary strengths of booleans and general
    propositions. *)

(** ** Classical vs. Constructive Logic *)

(** We have seen that it is not possible to test whether or not a
    proposition [P] holds while defining a Coq function.  You may be
    surprised to learn that a similar restriction applies to _proofs_!
    In other words, the following intuitive reasoning principle is not
    derivable in Coq: *)

Definition excluded_middle := forall P : Prop,
  P \/ ~ P.

(** To understand operationally why this is the case, recall that, to
    prove a statement of the form [P \/ Q], we use the [left] and
    [right] tactics, which effectively require knowing which side of
    the disjunction holds.  However, the universally quantified [P] in
    [excluded_middle] is an _arbitrary_ proposition, which we know
    nothing about.  We don't have enough information to choose which
    of [left] or [right] to apply, just as Coq doesn't have enough
    information to mechanically decide whether [P] holds or not inside
    a function.  On the other hand, if we happen to know that [P] is
    reflected in some boolean term [b], then knowing whether it holds
    or not is trivial: we just have to check the value of [b].  This
    leads to the following theorem: *)

Theorem restricted_excluded_middle : forall P b,
  (P <-> b = true) -> P \/ ~ P.
Proof.
  intros P [] H.
  - left. rewrite H. reflexivity.
  - right. rewrite H. intros contra. inversion contra.
Qed.

(** In particular, the excluded middle is valid for equations [n = m],
    between natural numbers [n] and [m].

    You may find it strange that the general excluded middle is not
    available by default in Coq; after all, any given claim must be
    either true or false.  Nonetheless, there is an advantage in not
    assuming the excluded middle: statements in Coq can make stronger
    claims than the analogous statements in standard mathematics.
    Notably, if there is a Coq proof of [exists x, P x], it is
    possible to explicitly exhibit a value of [x] for which we can
    prove [P x] -- in other words, every proof of existence is
    necessarily _constructive_.  Because of this, logics like Coq's,
    which do not assume the excluded middle, are referred to as
    _constructive logics_.  More conventional logical systems such as
    ZFC, in which the excluded middle does hold for arbitrary
    propositions, are referred to as _classical_.

    The following example illustrates why assuming the excluded middle
    may lead to non-constructive proofs: *)

(** _Claim_: There exist irrational numbers [a] and [b] such that [a ^
    b] is rational.

    _Proof_: It is not difficult to show that [sqrt 2] is irrational.
    If [sqrt 2 ^ sqrt 2] is rational, it suffices to take [a = b =
    sqrt 2] and we are done.  Otherwise, [sqrt 2 ^ sqrt 2] is
    irrational.  In this case, we can take [a = sqrt 2 ^ sqrt 2] and
    [b = sqrt 2], since [a ^ b = sqrt 2 ^ (sqrt 2 * sqrt 2) = sqrt 2 ^
    2 = 2].  []

    Do you see what happened here?  We used the excluded middle to
    consider separately the cases where [sqrt 2 ^ sqrt 2] is rational
    and where it is not, without knowing which one actually holds!
    Because of that, we wind up knowing that such [a] and [b] exist
    but we cannot determine what their actual values are (at least,
    using this line of argument).

    As useful as constructive logic is, it does have its limitations:
    There are many statements that can easily be proven in classical
    logic but that have much more complicated constructive proofs, and
    there are some that are known to have no constructive proof at
    all!  Fortunately, like functional extensionality, the excluded
    middle is known to be compatible with Coq's logic, allowing us to
    add it safely as an axiom.  However, we will not need to do so in
    this book: the results that we cover can be developed entirely
    within constructive logic at negligible extra cost.

    It takes some practice to understand which proof techniques must
    be avoided in constructive reasoning, but arguments by
    contradiction, in particular, are infamous for leading to
    non-constructive proofs.  Here's a typical example: suppose that
    we want to show that there exists [x] with some property [P],
    i.e., such that [P x].  We start by assuming that our conclusion
    is false; that is, [~ exists x, P x]. From this premise, it is not
    hard to derive [forall x, ~ P x].  If we manage to show that this
    intermediate fact results in a contradiction, we arrive at an
    existence proof without ever exhibiting a value of [x] for which
    [P x] holds!

    The technical flaw here, from a constructive standpoint, is that
    we claimed to prove [exists x, P x] using a proof of [~ ~ exists
    x, P x]. However, allowing ourselves to remove double negations
    from arbitrary statements is equivalent to assuming the excluded
    middle, as shown in one of the exercises below.  Thus, this line
    of reasoning cannot be encoded in Coq without assuming additional
    axioms. *)

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars (excluded_middle_irrefutable)  *)
(** The consistency of Coq with the general excluded middle axiom
    requires complicated reasoning that cannot be carried out within
    Coq itself.  However, the following theorem implies that it is
    always safe to assume a decidability axiom (i.e., an instance of
    excluded middle) for any _particular_ Prop [P].  Why? Because we
    cannot prove the negation of such an axiom; if we could, we would
    have both [~ (P \/ ~P)] and [~ ~ (P \/ ~P)], a contradiction. *)
